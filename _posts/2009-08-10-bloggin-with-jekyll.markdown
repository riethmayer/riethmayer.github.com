title: blogging with jekyll

## Allright, a new blog again. But why?

I often play around with different blogs, writing my own, using different approaches. I have to admit, it's fun for me, building new sites and testing new frameworks.

or my *"[company](http://optimiere.com "Softwareentwicklung")"*
 page I wrote lots of code. Writing code is good, but starting over and over from scratch, using good old rails erb first, then [#haml and sass](http://haml-lang.com/ "#haml"), using [blueprint](http://www.blueprintcss.org/ "Blueprint: A CSS Framework | Spend your time innovating, not replicating") and finally [yui grids](http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/grids/ "Yahoo! UI Library: Grids CSS"). Playing around with [openid](http://openid.net/ "OpenID Foundation website"), [authlogic](http://github.com/binarylogic/authlogic/tree/master "binarylogic's authlogic at master - GitHub") and [restful-authentication](http://github.com/technoweenie/restful-authentication/tree/master "technoweenie's restful-authentication at master - GitHub") is cool, but all my posts are gone and links get broken. Aaahhhwwww poor me :)

Well yeah, it's not that important what I wrote, but somehow it would be nice to have all my posts back again (I bet they are still out there, but spread over different databases). I never backed them up, because I didn't give a Shit about it. But somehow, growing older means getting more sentimental :D So, here is my solution:

[Jekyll](http://wiki.github.com/mojombo/jekyll "Home - jekyll - GitHub"), an awesome ruby gem, that allows me to create blog posts from my beloved [texteditor](http://macromates.com/ "TextMate â€” The Missing Editor for Mac OS X"). A plus on nerdfactor regarding my way of hacking stuff. No more lame textfields in browsers. And as another plus, all my posts in plain text on my favorite social coding platform [github.com](http://github.com/ "Secure source code hosting and collaborative development - GitHub").

Sounds great, doesn't it? Next question is, what to use to write the actual text? [textile markup](http://hobix.com/textile/ "Textile Reference") doesn&#x27;t feel so natural to mee. Maybe I&#x27;m going to have a look at [maruku](http://maruku.rubyforge.org/ "Maruku: a Markdown-superset interpreter") soon. Read somewhere it somehow talks to [LaTeX](http://www.latex-project.org/ "LaTeX project: LaTeX &ndash; A document preparation system"), that would be yummi :D

That&#x27;s a start for my new blog :)
